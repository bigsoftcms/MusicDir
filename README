To mount this fs, use a command like:
  mountfs.py /tmp/mnt -d -s -o ro,allow_other -db <full_path_to_db_file>

The -d flag is optional - it puts the fs into debug mode. The -s flag, however,
is mandatory (single thread mode).

Currently, the fs is hardcoded to the DB to use - in this case, it's
~/Projects/MusicDir/full.db. This should probably be converted into a command-line
flag.



===========================================================
To build a database from a filesystem, use:
dbloader.py <style> <database file> <path1> <path2> ...

NEED TO IMPLEMENT FILTERS on dbloader, so we can handle different ways
of seeing the same thing (genres have Sound Track, Soundtrack, etc. Artist
has RJ Dio, Ronnie James Dio, etc.) Should have a filter when reading tags
that compares the inputs with a list of known alternatives, and adds the real 
version.
GenreDict = {"Sound Track":"Soundtrack",
             "soundtrack" :"Soundtrack", ... etc.}
===========================================================
To dump the contents of the database, use:

dumpdb.py <database file>
